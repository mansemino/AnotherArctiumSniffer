Another Arctium Sniffer

Sniffer for Retail 5.3.x & PTR 5.4.x (32 bits) clients. It will create Arctium Dump files, to browse and parse them with my ArctiumSnifferBrowser or with your own tools...

Features:

- Universal sniffer. You don't need updates for future 5.3.x / 5.4.x clients (crossed fingers!)
- If no client detected, it will wait for the first instance (you can launch the sniffer first and then the client)
- Multiple clients support: It will give you the option to choose to which unhooked client will be attached
- No consoles: Once you hook to a client, all console windows will be closed. No need for more windows in background :)
- In case of multiple hooked clients, it'll create one dump file for each client

A lot of thanks to:

- Fabi for his emulator, support, suggestions and for teaching about WoW emulation & client stuff
- Anuka/Anubysss: For his brilliant sniffer. I found on it the piece I need to complete mine.
- Arctium IRC, forums & community for support the Arctium Project
